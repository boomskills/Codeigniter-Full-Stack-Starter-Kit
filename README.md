# Quick Start

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Holoog/Codeiginter-Full-Stack-Starter-Kit
```

## Next run

```
> composer install
```

Ensure composer is already installed on your system.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env`

# Development with Docker

To run the application locally, using docker, ensure docker is already installed on your system, run the following commands.

```
> docker-compose up â€“-build
```

or

```
> docker-compose up -d
```

The second command will run docker in the background, it may not be the best option when running the app for the first time as you may want to track the progress in case there will be some errors, so a recommended option is to run the first command.

## Next run:

```
> docker ps
```

Find the `container ID` of the `app` something like `codeigniter-fullstack-starter-kit`

## Next run

Login into the container by executing

```
> docker exec -it CONTAINER-ID bash
```

# Migrations

Run the below command while logged in docker.

```
> php spark migrate
```
